# foundryvtt-macros

Some of these are 5e specific, especially the Character Dialog, Chat Messages Dialog, Health Vitaliy Change, and Vitality Change.
Those macros are designed for streamlining play using inline rolls and 'fake' inline roll styled buttons instead of automation.
I found that I disliked the constant treadmell of keeping up with automating the dnd5e system. 
These macros aim to simplify play by keeping the system as much of a dice game as it can be while still using Foundry's powerful UI.
